Innocent? Who's innocent? Wayne? You innocent?

I'm innocent, yes, I am. Of murder, definitely. 

It's just murder, man. All God's creatures do it in some form or another. I mean, look in the forest, you got species killing other species. Our species killing all species including the forest, and we just call it industry, not murder. But I know a lot of people who deserve to die. 

Why do they deserve to die?

I think everybody got something in their past. Some sin. Some awful, secret thing. A lot of people walking around already dead just need to be put out of their misery. That's where I come in. Fate's messenger. Except a corn or wheat falleth to the ground and die, it abideth alone. But if it die it bringeth forth much fruit.

The theory that "everyone meets a serial killer halfway" thing? Is that what you're saying?

The wolf don't know why he's a wolf, the deer don't know why he's a deer. God just made it that way. 

You're saying that the world itself is predatory. that when a mountain lion takes down an elk, it's because it's the elk's time to go. And the B.S. Iiberal agenda about saving the herds only serves to overpopulate the balance of nature. 

Maybe you're right. I don't think so, but maybe you are. Corporate and environmental predators. Nuclear predators. Life is a hunt. I've seen it, I was there. When the shit hit the fan at Grenada, I saw it all go down at Grenada. 

So tell me, Mickey, any regrets? I mean, three weeks, 50 people killed. Not too cool, Mickey. 

Fifty-two, but I don't spend a lot of time with regret. That's a wasted emotion. 

Seriously, you must have some regret. Rack your brain.

And was it really worth it? Was what worth it? Was massacring all those people worth being separated from your love for the rest of your life?

You mean, was an instant of my purity worth a lifetime of your lies? 

Please explain, where is the purity that you couldn't live without in the 52 people who are no longer on this planet, because they met you and Mallory? What's so fucking pure about that? How do you do it? 

You'll never understand. You and me, we're not even the same species. I used to be you, then I evolved. From where you're standing, you're a man. From where I'm standing, you're an ape. You're not even an ape, you're a media person. Media 's like the weather, only it's man-made weather. Murder? It's pure. You're the one made it impure. You're buying and selling fear. You say. "Why?" I say "Why bother?" 

Are you done? Great. Now let's cut the B.S. and get real. Why this purity that you feel about killing? Why, for chrissakes! Don't lie!

I guess, Wayne, you just gotta hold that shotgun in your hand, and it becomes clear like it did for me the first time. That's when I realized my one true calling in life. 

What's that, Mickey? Shit, man. I'm a natural born killer.
